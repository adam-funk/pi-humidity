Client:

On each pass, write to sqlite DB.
Columns:
epoch, iso_time, identifier, temperature, humidity, transmitted=false

Then query DB for transmitted=false; try to transmit each one and
update DB.


Server:
Use a config file for everything.
Run without screen or terminal.

Config:
 - data file
 - log file

Start from cron @reboot?
Maybe with a script with some delay at the beginning.
